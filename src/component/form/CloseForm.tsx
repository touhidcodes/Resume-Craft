              It pays to be picky about the academic accomplishments that you
              list on your resume. Employers want to see a maximum of three
              education entries in a resume.* If you have more academic
              achievements, consider listing them under one of your main
              education entries.

              Listing your education shows that you meet any necessary
              prerequisites to employment and allows you to showcase your book
              smarts if youâ€™re a little short on actual experience.
